Trends in Price of Commodities in every APMC. Challenge 1: Agriculture Commodities, Prices & Seasons

Aim: Your team is working on building a variety of insight packs to measure key trends in the Agriculture sector in India. You are presented with a data set around Agriculture and your aim is to understand trends in APMC (Agricultural produce market committee)/mandi price & quantity arrival data for different commodities in Maharashtra.

Objective:

Test and filter outliers.
Understand price fluctuations accounting the seasonal effect
Detect seasonality type (multiplicative or additive) for each cluster of APMC and commodities
De-seasonalise prices for each commodity and APMC according to the detected seasonality type
Compare prices in APMC/Mandi with MSP(Minimum Support Price)- raw and deseasonalised
Flag set of APMC/mandis and commodities with highest price fluctuation across different commodities in each relevant season, and year.


Variable description: •	msprice- Minimum Support Price •	arrivals_in_qtl- Quantity arrival in market (in quintal) •	min_price- Minimum price charged per quintal •	max_price- Maximum price charged per quintal •	modal_price- Mode (Average) price charged per quintal

Submissions:

Final cleaned file(s). 
Documentation around the methodology, analysis, and final results 
Script(s) and their documentation. (Bonus - using R Studio or GitHub ReadMe.)
Visualisations, if any. 
Tip: The objective is to understand trends in each APMC and commodity separately so doing the analysis for just 1 commodity or APMC won’t help.
